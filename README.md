# Autocomplete Engine
I built an autocomplete engine to explore different algorithmic approaches and their tradeoffs 
- Implemented three aproaches: brute force, binary search, and prefix hash map
- Compared their perfomance and memory tradeoffs
- Focused on data structures, efficency, and clean design
